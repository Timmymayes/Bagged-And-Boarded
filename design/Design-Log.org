*  Bagged & Boarded: An Origin Story
** My gaming history

The initial inspiration for Bagged & Boarded derives distinctly from my childhood experiences. The first of which is rooted in the foundation of my interest in gaming; I got my gaming genes from my mother. Growing up my family would play a mix of mass market games like clue and trouble as well as classic card games, such as Rummy, Pinochle, Euchre, spades etc. I specifically loved the skills that card games utilized. Memory of what's been played or taken contrasted with what is left in the deck. Collecting connecting cards that had better odds to connect in future turns, holding high ranks and baiting with low ranks. When I was older it was no surprise to me that I gravitated towards poker and developed an appreciation for the deep mathematics involved there.

I was also a big fan of all types of fantasy, especially comic books. While I did most of my serious collecting with Magic The Gathering, the reality is I never found those cards thematic or rich in story the way I did comic books. As a kid I only collected comics for the stories but I was very aware of the collecting culture that overarched the industry. 

** A game idea is born

The seed idea for Bagged & Boarded was the thought that a card is the perfect shape for a comic book cover. The idea came to me when playing the game Food Fight from Cryptozoic Entertainment. The card art was stylish and reminded me of old school comic book art. Food fight is a drafting game and the very first ( and not so good ) iteration of Bagged and Boarded was a drafting focused game. I had recently discovered drafting as a game mechanism and everytime I found a new mechanism I liked, I obsessed over it.

Bagged and boarded was going to be a drafting and tableau building game. You would draft at the start for an initial collection of starting comics, then the deck would represent new comics which would be drafted from every round and finally the discard would be a face down pile called the bargain bin which was also drafted from. So much drafting!

Of course you couldn't just draft cards. They needed powers and abilities and the cards you drafted had to be worth points, bigger points for bigger sets of matching comic lines. This initial version of the game had 100 unique cards all with unique abilities. The tableau building element enabled some powers to give you passive boosts/effects and "sleeved & unsleeved" states that you would notate by tapping the cards. If you got a card from the bargain bin, it entered played sleeved, effectively powerless except for gaining you points.

** Rebooting

The very first couple of playtests with friends went ok. They were nice and supportive and I was hyped that I finally made a game I could show off. My realization that the game wasn't exactly fun came shortly after those initial playtests. I knew in my heart however that the game was simply mediocre. At that point I shelved it with a fuzzy plan of "I'll  work on it again one day."

A few years later a juncture in my professional life caused a massive influx of free time. I quit my job, without a new one lined up. To fill the time between job hunting, and to repair my depleted mental health from the toxic work environment I had recently escaped,  it was time to take  another shot at my comic book collecting game.

At this point I had now discovered worker placement / action selection games, one of the most utilzied and interesting mechanism in the games I had played to date. I also noticed that both set collecting and resource development were features of these euro games that I really loved. I also noticed that the set collection element of many euro games was a simplified feature. They lacked the magic that I felt when playing Rummy or Gin with my mother. Where many players see a deck of cards as an element of uncontrollable randomness. My experience with reading peoples play and tracking cards had me seeing the deck as an opportunity to be unique.

It also just so happens that the characters perfectly represent suits where the issue numbers map into card ranks. The game basically invented itself. 

** Bagged & Boarded

After a quick assessment of my original set of cards I realized that I only wanted to keep a few thematic bits. The facedown discard, or "bargain bin", scaling points based on set size, and starting everyone with an initial collection of comics to form some direction for their starting hunt for comics.

With the cards of the deck mapping so perfectly over top of a standard deck of cards, albiet with a lot more suits. The main problem I had to solve was what types of actions players would take. I settled on 3 core goals the players would have; Find comics, Make money to fund comic purchases, enhance the value of the comics you've found. Every action in the game traces back to those three goals with the exception of turn order.

The final piece of the puzzle to start building the game was figuring out the action selection mechanism. The game's theme to me was always a group of kids trying to build the best comic book collection. Kids commanding workers to do their bidding is a cool idea but just doesn't fit the theme. Instead I decided it's summertime so they have a lot of free time since school is out. This let me utilize time as the action mechanism. In the game you get 12 hours of time to work on your collection. This might seem random but was chosen quite purposefully. I wanted the actions in the game to typically be 2, 3 or 4 hours in duration. With 12 hours you can split your turns up in lots of little combinations of those numbers using 12. It also gives a nice thematic element to the game when a player deep dives into the bargain bin and spends huge chunks of time there. 

In the end the game delivers elements that a wide range of player types can enjoy. The tight thematic mapping between the mechanisms and the comic collecting theme makes the game easy to learn and approchable for new players. It does all this without giving up depth of play. Experienced players will enjoy toying with a solid economic engine with a multitude of interaction points and robust deck tracking and manipulation via the game's actions.
